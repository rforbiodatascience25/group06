# 1. Aim

# 2. **Load packages**

To carry out the analysis, we used packages from the `tidyverse` collection along with `broom` for tidying model outputs and `cowplot` for plot themes.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)  # devtools::install_github("tidymodels/broom")
library(cowplot)
```

# 3. **Load data**

We use the `biopsy` dataset, available online through the repository. The code below downloads the data and store it locally the first time, the script is run. In subsequent runs the data is only reloaded.

```{r}
biopsy <- read_csv("https://wilkelab.org/classes/SDS348/data_sets/biopsy.csv")
```
