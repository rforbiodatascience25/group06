## Join

### Anti join

Joins everything in the first dataset, that is not overlapping with the second dataset

```{r}
anti_join(X, Y, by = "id")
```

## Table 1 - cohort presentation

The table 1 command creates the classic table known from scientific papers as one of the first tables, which presents the cohort and its characteristics like gender, age etc.

```{r}
library("table1") # <= Yes, this should normally go at the beginning!
meta_data |>
  mutate(Gender = factor(Gender),
         Cohort = factor(Cohort)) |>
  table1(x = formula(~ Gender + Age + Race | Cohort),
         data = _)
```
